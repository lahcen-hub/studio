/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Cargo Calculation App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only
 * access calculations they have created. All write operations are restricted to the
 * owner of the calculation.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The primary data is stored in the `/calculations/{calculationId}` collection.
 * Each document represents a single calculation entry and contains a `uid` field
 * that identifies the owner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own calculations.
 * - Listing calculations is only allowed for the owner.
 * - The rules do NOT enforce a strict schema for the data within the documents,
 *   allowing for flexible data shapes during prototyping. However, the rules
 *   DO enforce that the 'uid' matches the authenticated user's ID.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `uid` field is denormalized directly onto the `calculation` documents to allow
 * for efficient ownership checks without additional reads.
